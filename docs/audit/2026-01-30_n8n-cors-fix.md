# Audit Log: CORS Fix for n8n Webhook

**Date:** 2026-01-30
**Action:**
- Configured n8n webhook to send CORS headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`) in HTTP Response node.
- Resolved frontend error: "Access to fetch at ... has been blocked by CORS policy" when submitting the Contact form.
- Verified that lead submission from frontend to n8n webhook now works correctly.

**Reason:**
- Browser security blocks cross-origin requests unless backend sends proper CORS headers.
- Ensures seamless integration between frontend and n8n automation backend for lead intake.
